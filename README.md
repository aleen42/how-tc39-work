> A mysterious organization `神秘组织`, the Technical Committee 39, a.k.a. TC30

Why do I want to share this topic with you? Because I have successfully drafted `草拟` a proposal to contribute to JavaScript, and it is currently in stage 1, which will be presented to the committee soon. Here I just want to share with you a process `贡献过程` when you want a contribution, or you have any suggestions on the JavaScript specifications.

Before introducing how to do it, we need to know something about [`JavaScript`](javascript.md), and [`TC39`](tc39.md).
