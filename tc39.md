## TC39 [Back](README.md)

Ecma International's Technical committee `技术委员会` 39 is a group of JavaScript developers, implementers, academics `学者`, and more, collaborating with the community to maintain and evolve the definition of JavaScript. Ecma International `Ecma 国际` is an industry association dedicated to the standardization of information and communication systems. To put it simple, it is design for making specifications `制定规范` not only for JavaScript but also other languages like `C#`, `Dart`, `Eiffel` or other domains like information storage,
close proximity electric induction data transfer, etc.
